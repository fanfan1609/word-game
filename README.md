Build an HTML5 interactive dictionary  (let’s call it “app”) that functions as the one shown in the attached video. The app will be the central part of a web page.

Requirements:

1) Responsive design. Should work on desktops and mobile (both portrait and landscape). For mobile, it should cover about 80% of the screen.

2) All settings, words, translations and links to audio files will be contained in an external XML file (see the attached example) located on the same server. No database or CMS required.

3) Clean code. Descriptive variable names. Well commented. Easy to modify.

4) As shown in the video, the bottom of the app will include links and an “about” button which will open an “about” box.

5) As shown in the video, all the buttons will be animated when the page containing the app loads.
